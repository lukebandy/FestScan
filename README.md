# FestScan

Overwhelemed by a music festival's lineup? FestScan takes your Spotify listening history and provides you with a personalised schedule of both your favourite artists and of ones that Spotify thinks you'd enjoy, as well as a playlist of those artists to help you get warmed up.

Currently, Glastonbury 2022 is the only festival included, but more will be in the future.
